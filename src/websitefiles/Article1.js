              The current logistics scenario increasingly demands accurate and
              fast deliveries. With efficient transportation fleet management,
              it is possible to ensure a good view of the market. The use of
              real-time monitoring technologies emerges as a key solution to
              solve the challenges faced by freight brokers, carriers, and large
              companies. Isovia Freight &amp; Fleet Manager (IFM) is an
              operating system that integrates these functions and will
              integrate tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) in the
              future, which will provide connectivity and automation to optimize
              operations, reduce costs, and increase fleet efficiency.

              Given the rapid changes in the logistics sector, companies are
              increasingly demanding real-time monitoring of their operations.
              In order to make good, fast and accurate decisions, traditional
              tracking solutions, although useful, no longer offer much
              flexibility to businesses.
              <br />
              With the IFM system, fleet operations are improved, allowing
              companies to monitor driver and vehicle performance, optimizing
              routes while complying with the law. This real-time monitoring
              offers a very high level of control over more traditional
              management, which ensures a significant improvement in operational
              efficiency.{" "}

                      real-time updates for brokers, carriers and cargo
                      customers on a constant basis.
