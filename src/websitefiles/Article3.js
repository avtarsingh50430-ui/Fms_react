              Freight transportation is an essential part of the global economy,
              where various goods and products are transported to different
              locations to maintain supplies. However, it is one of the most
              damaging sectors due to its greenhouse gas emissions and the
              consequent consumption of natural resources. Therefore, to
              minimize such environmental impacts, it is necessary to adopt
              sustainable solutions in its planning. The use of optimized
              routes, the full capacity of vehicles and the use of clean
              technologies are some of the solutions that make transportation
              more efficient and environmentally friendly. In this article, the
              relationship between sustainability and freight planning is
              addressed based on the logistics solutions that can reduce the
              impact of such activity on the environment.

              Sustainable logistics is becoming a main strategy to reduce the

                  <h2>Route Optimization</h2>
                  <p>
                    The adoption of this method can significantly reduce travel
                    time and fuel consumption. Technologies based on Artificial
                    Intelligence and Big Data will calculate the best routes
                    with greater precision in real time, avoiding congestion and

                  <p>
                    When trucks, ships and planes are ensured to work close to
                    their maximum capacity, the number of trips involving the
                    volume of cargo transported can be effectively reduced.
                    Cooperation between companies and the implementation of
                    strategies for the insertion of cargo favors efficiency.

                    hybrid or biodiesel and natural gas powered vehicles helps
                    to contain CO2 emissions and other atmospheric pollutants.

                    technologies that allow remote measurement and sensors
                    allows regular monitoring of vehicle performance, which
